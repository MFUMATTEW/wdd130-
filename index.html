        <p> Hello my name is Flavien Mabouba, i am from Gabon,
            and i really like music and movies.
            I served a full time mission in Ghana Accra.
            I learned that the lord can help us in many ways
            even when we feel lost or depressed.
            I decided to further my education through BYU pathway worldwide.
            I have always been interested by new technologies that is
            why i chose Software and development. i want to learn more about
            technology especially AI and i know, if i work hard i can achieve this Goal. </p>
